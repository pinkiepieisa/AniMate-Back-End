# Local secrets for AniMate backend (DO NOT commit a file named secrets.properties)
#
# Usage:
# 1. Copy this file to `secrets.properties` in the same folder as `application.properties`.
# 2. Edit the copied file and set your Chibisafe URL and API key.
# 3. Start the backend normally; Spring Boot will import the values automatically.
#
# Example content (uncomment or copy into `secrets.properties`):
# chibisafe.url=http://localhost:24424
# chibisafe.apikey=YOUR_CHIBISAFE_API_KEY_HERE

# Notes:
# - This file is intentionally gitignored by the repository so you don't accidentally commit secrets.
# - You can also provide these values via environment variables:
#     CHIBISAFE_URL and CHIBISAFE_APIKEY
# - Alternatively start the JVM with: -Dchibisafe.apikey="YOUR_KEY"

# Uncomment and/or copy the following two lines into your local `secrets.properties` file:
#chibisafe.url=http://localhost:24424
#chibisafe.apikey=YOUR_CHIBISAFE_API_KEY_HERE
